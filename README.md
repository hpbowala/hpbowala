## About

I am a software engineer and postgraduate AI student focused on building scalable AI systems — not just model demos.

My interests sit at the intersection of:

- LLM architectures & agent systems  
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)  
- Knowledge graphs & semantic systems  
- ML evaluation & robustness  
- Backend systems for AI workloads  
- Systems design for AI infrastructure  

I aim to engineer AI platforms, not wrappers.

## Engineering Philosophy

- Prefer systems over scripts  
- Prefer evaluation over hype  
- Prefer robustness over novelty  
- Understand abstractions before scaling them
