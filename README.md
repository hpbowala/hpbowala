## About

Software engineer and postgraduate AI student focused on building scalable, interpretable AI systems — not just model demos.

Primary interests:

- LLM architectures & agent systems  
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)  
- Explainable AI (XAI) & model interpretability  
- Knowledge graphs & semantic systems  
- ML evaluation & robustness  
- Backend infrastructure for AI workloads  
- Systems design for AI-native platforms  

I aim to engineer AI platforms that are scalable, measurable, and interpretable.
